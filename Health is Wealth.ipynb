It would be mutually beneficial for citizens (whose health is at stake) and private investors (who would invest their wealth) and/or the government (that would look out for the welfare of its citizens) to know where to set up hospitals for addressing any shortage. This project aims to highlight the distribution of hospitals within Delhi's neighbourhoods and point out holes to be filled, so as to cater to the ever-growing demand.",
